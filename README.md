simple mvc framework for nodejs

I create this project when i learn nodejs.
You can learn nodejs and mvc framework from this website.
http://www.nodebeginner.org/

If you dont want to use express, koa and sails ...,
just want a simple example to create website quickly.
This will be a good choice.

How to use 
0. sudo apt-get install nodejs

1. Just put your file in right folder.
   Put your static files in client folder .
   index.html is your main html (you can change this in route.js)

2. Go to server and 
   " node server.js " You can check 127.0.0.1:8888/index.html 

3. If you want to build dynamic website , go to server folder and add code.

if you familiar with Django or CodeIgniter , you will like it .
